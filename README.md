# irace-independent-executions

This repository contains grouped datasets for independent executions of algorithm configuration experiments using [irace](https://github.com/MLopez-Ibanez/irace). The main goal is to tune three algorithms across different scenarios:

- **ACOTSP**: 4 scenarios
- **MMASQAP**: 4 scenarios
- **PSO-X**: 12 scenarios

Each folder in the repository corresponds to one of these algorithms and contains the respective scenarios.

The version of irace used for these experiments is a modified one, available at: [https://github.com/Imperialdramon/irace-with-raceData](https://github.com/Imperialdramon/irace-with-raceData).  
The original irace repository can be found at: [https://github.com/MLopez-Ibanez/irace](https://github.com/MLopez-Ibanez/irace).
